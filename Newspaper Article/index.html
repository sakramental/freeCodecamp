        It will be very difficult to break records with broken «American boards» at tournaments in Japan.<br>In the article Tameshiwari Records of the Absolute World Championships, we calculated (combining the best attempts of all championships), the potential Tameshiwari record for tournaments in Japan is 35 boards (7 | 10 | 9 | 9).<br>
            So the main tameshiwari record is still ahead!</p>
