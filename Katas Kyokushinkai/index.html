        <p>The word <code>kata</code> means "shape" or "form". The kanji for <code>kata</code> the Japanese character is composed of the following characters:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>Katachi</code> meaning "Shape",</li>
          <li><code>Kai</code> meaning "Cut",</li>
          <li>and <code>Tsuchi</code> meaning "Earth" or "Soil".</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Literally translated, <code>kata</code> means "shape which cuts the ground".</p>
        <p>A <code>kata</code> is a sequence of blocks, kicks and punches from one or more stances, involving movement forward, backward and to the sides. The number of movements and their sequence are very specific. The balance between offensive and defensive techniques, the stances used and the direction and flow of movement all serve to give each <code>kata</code> its distinctive character.</p>
        <p>Through the practice of <code>kata</code>, the traditional techniques used for fighting are learned. Balance, coordination, breathing and concentration are also developed. Done properly, <code>kata</code> are an excellent physical exercise and a very effective form of total mind and body conditioning. <code>Kata</code> embodies the idea of <code>ren ma</code>, or "always polishing" – with diligent practice, the moves of the <code>kata</code> become further refined and perfected. The attention to detail that is necessary to perfect a <code>kata</code> cultivates self discipline.</p>
        <p>Through concentration, dedication and practice, a higher level of learning may be achieved, where the <code>kata</code> is so ingrained in the subconscious mind that no conscious attention is needed. This is what the Zen masters call <code>mushin</code>, or "no mind." The conscious, rational thought practice is not used at all – what was once memorized is now spontaneous.</p>
        <p>The practice of traditional <code>kata</code> is also a way for the karateka to pay respect to the origins and history of Kyokushin Karate and the martial arts in general.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Origins_of_Kata">
        <header>Origins of Kata</header>
        <p>Kyokushin <code>kata</code> are often categorized as "Northern Kata" or "Southern Kata," based upon their origin and development.</p>
        <p>The Northern Kata are similar to those found in Shotokan Karate, since they were developed from Mas Oyama's training under Gichin Funakoshi. Master Funakoshi in turn derived these <code>kata</code> from northern Chinese kempo and Shorin Ryu, the Okinawan karate style based on Chinese Shaolin (i.e. "Shorin") kempo. These <code>kata</code> utilize long, powerful stances and strong blocks and strikes. The Northern Kata include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Taikyoku Sono Ichi, Ni and San</li>
          <li>Pinan Sono Ichi, Ni, San, Yon and Go</li>
          <li>Yansu</li>
          <li>Tsuki no Kata</li>
          <li>Kanku</li>
          <li>Sushiho</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Southern Kata were developed from Mas Oyama's study of the Okinawan karate style of Goju Ryu under So Nei Chu, which in turn were derived from southern Chinese kempo. The movements in these <code>kata</code> are more circular and flamboyant than those in the Northern Kata. The Southern Kata include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sanchin no Kata</li>
          <li>Gekisai Dai and Sho</li>
          <li>Tensho</li>
          <li>Saipha</li>
          <li>Seienchin</li>
          <li>Garyu</li>
          <li>Seipai</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_Importance_of_Kata_Practices">
        <header>The Importance of Kata Practices</header>
        <p>One cannot emphasize enough the importance of <code>kata</code> in karate training.</p>
        <p>Mas Oyama in his book “Mas Oyama’s Essential Karate” compared learning karate to learning a language. Kihon or learning basic techniques is equivalent to learning the letters of the alphabet. <code>Kata</code> training is equivalent to learning to speak in sentences. And, kumite practice is analogous to learning to converse.</p>
        <p>Mas Oyama also noted that “it is essential for the karateka to learn the <code>kata</code> totally” and this means being able to apply what he or she learns from the <code>kata</code> to actual combat “with split-second accuracy“.</p>
        <p>In order to accomplish this, Mas Oyama’s view is that you need to practice a kata from 3,000 to 10,000 times and that it is better to know one <code>kata</code> exceptionally well than to know many <code>katas</code> superficially.

        <h4>Taikyoku, Sokugi Taikyoku </h4>
        <p>Taikyoku is literally translated as "grand ultimate", and in Chinese, the kanji characters are pronounced Tai Chi. The word Taikyoku can also mean overview or the whole point – seeing the whole rather than focusing on the individual parts, and keeping an open mind or beginner's mind. The beginner's mind is what is strived for during training and in life. The beginner's mind does not hold prejudice and does not cling to a narrow view. The beginner's mind is open to endless possibilities.</p>
         <h4>Pinan</h4>
<p>Pinan is the Okinawan pronunciation of the kanji characters for peace and relaxation (pronounced Heian in Japanese). Though the physical moves of <code>kata</code> involve techniques used for fighting, the purpose of <code>kata</code> is to develop a calm, peaceful mind and harmony between the mind and body.</p>

        <header>Breathing Kata</header>
        <h4>Sanchin</h4>
        <p>Sanchin literally means "three battles" or "three conflicts". It is the principal <code>kata</code> in certain Okinawan karate styles, such as Goju Ryu and Uechi Ryu, and it is likely one of the oldest <code>kata</code>. Certain legends attribute the creation of Sanchin to Bodhidharma in the early sixth century. Sanchin <code>kata</code> seeks to develop three elements at the same time:</p>
        <p>The mind, body and the techniques, the internal organs, circulation and the nervous system, and the three ki, located in:
          <ul>
            <li>the top of the head (<code>tento</code>),</li>
            <li>the diaphragm (<code>hara</code>), and</li>
            <li>the lower abdomen (<code>tan den</code>).</li></ul>
        <p>Sanchin is an isometric <code>kata</code> where each move is performed in a state of complete tension, accompanied by powerful, deep breathing (ibuki) that originates in the lower abdomen (tan den). The practice of Sanchin not only leads to the strengthening of the body, but to the development of the inner power (ki) and the coordination of mind and body.</p>
        <h4>Tensho</h4>
        <p>Tensho means rolling or fluid hand, literally translated as "rotating palms". Tensho is the soft and circular (yin) counterpart to the hard and linear (yang) Sanchin <code>kata</code>. Not only was Tensho one of Mas Oyama's favorite <code>kata</code>, he considered it to be the most indispensable of the advanced <code>kata</code>:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tensho is a basic illustration of the definition of Karate, derived from Chinese kempo, as a technique of circles based on points.</li>
            <li>Tensho should be a prime object of practice because, as a psychological and theoretical support behind karate training and as a central element in basic karate formal exercises, it has permeated the techniques, the blocks and the thrusts, and is intimately connected with the very life of karate.</li>
          <li>A man who has practiced Tensho <code>kata</code> a number of thousands of times and has a firm grasp of its theory can not only take any attack, but can also turn the advantage in any attack, and will always be able to defend himself perfectly.</li>

        <h4>Tsuki No Kata</h4>
        <p>Tsuki no by its very name is a punching <code>kata</code> (there is only one kick and just a few blocks in the entire <code>kata</code>). The word Tsuki can also mean fortune and luck. Good fortune and luck does not come by waiting. For every punch in this <code>kata</code>, envision that a personal barrier is being broken down. Strong, persistent effort directed at problems will bring good fortune.</p>
        <h4>Yantsu</h4>
        <p>Yantsu is derived from the characters Yan, meaning safe, and Su, meaning three. The name is attributed to that of a Chinese military attaché to Okinawa in the 19th Century. The word yansu also means to keep pure, striving to maintain the purity of principles and ideals rather than compromising for expediency.</p>
        <h4>Gekisai (Sono Ichi, Ni, San)</h4>
        <p>Gekisai means conquer and occupy. The name is derived from the characters Geki, meaning attack or conquer, and Sai, meaning fortress or stronghold (literally translated as "closed", "shut" or "covered"). The word Gekisai can also mean demolish, destroy or pulverize. The <code>katas</code> teach strength through fluidity of motion, mobility and the utilization of various techniques. Flexibility of attack and response will always be superior to rigid and inflexible strength.</p>
        <h4>Saipha</h4>
        <p>Saipha means extreme destruction, smashing or tearing. The word Saipha can also mean great wave. No matter how large a problem is encountered, with patience, determination and perseverance (Osu) one can rise above and overcome it, or smash through and get beyond it.</p>

        <h4>Seienchin</h4>
        <p>Seienchin means conqueror and subdue over a distance, or attack the rebellious outpost. In feudal Japan, Samurai warriors would often go on expeditions lasting many months, and they needed to maintain their strength and spirit over a long period of time. This <code>kata</code> is long and slow, with many techniques performed from kiba dachi (horseback stance). The legs usually become very tired in this <code>kata</code>, and a strong spirit is needed to persevere, instead of giving up. The word Seienchin can also mean to pull in battle.</p>
          <h4>Seipai</h4>
          <p>Seipai is the Okinawan pronunciation of the kanji characters for 18 (pronounced Ju Hachi in Japanese). In other karate styles, this <code>kata</code> is sometimes called Seipaite, or eighteen hands. The number 18 is derived from the Buddhist concept of 6 x 3, where six represents color, voice, taste, smell, touch and justice and three represents good, bad and peace.</p>
          <h4>Garyu</h4>
          <p>Garyu means reclining dragon. In Japanese philosophy, a great man who remains in obscurity is called a Garyu. A dragon is all-powerful, but a reclining dragon chooses not to display his power until it is needed. Likewise, a true karateka does not brag about or show off his abilities. He never forgets the true virtue of humility.</p>
          <h4>Kanku</h4>
          <p>Kanku means sky gazing. Literally translated, Kan means "view", and Ku means "universe", "air", "emptiness" or "void" (the same character as Kara in karate). The first move of the <code>kata</code> is the formation of an opening with the hands above the head, through which one gazes at the universe and rising sun. The significance is that no matter what problems are faced, each day is new and the universe is waiting. Nothing is so terrible that it affects the basic reality of existence.</p>
          <h4>Sushiho</h4>
          <p>Sushiho means 54 steps. Sushiho is derived from the words Useshi, the Okinawan pronunciation of the kanji characters for 54 (pronounced Go Ju Shi in Japanese), and Ho, meaning walk or step. Other karate styles call this advanced <code>kata</code> Gojushiho.</p>
