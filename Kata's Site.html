        <h1>Basic Kyukushin Katas</h1>
        <p>This page provides free videos & instructions for Basic Kyokushin katas. It will help you to prepare for your first Kyokushin Karate belt test. To master these Basic Kyokushin Karate katas, you will also have to learn basic Kyokushin stances. In order to pass your first belt tests, many Kyokushin schools also require that you know the meanings of Kyokushin kata. Please check with your Sensei/Instructor regarding your required kata movements as some Kyokushin Karate schools use slightly different kata formats. In addition, a number of Kyokushin Karate schools have their kata in different orders/sequences based on the preference of the school’s Sensei and system.</p>

            <h2>Taikyoku Sono San</h2>
            <p>This page provides details about Kyokushin Kata – Taikyoku Sono San. This is a color belt (non-black belt) Kyokushin Karate kata.<br>
            To master many of these kata, Karate students should try to imagine that they are fighting an imaginary opponent. This allows students to practice “offensive” or “defensive” techniques (i.e. strike the imaginary opponent’s neck at the correct height and angle) versus just going through the motions in order to pass a belt test.</p>
